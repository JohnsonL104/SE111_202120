                <p>The Room is a masterpiece produced, written, directed and starred Tommy Wiseua. The movie is full of best friends, spoons, footballs, chicken dances, and of course, love. The main plot between Johnny, Lisa and Mark complemented by Denny and Chris-r’s side plot and the heartbreaking news of Claudette’s breast cancer just make this movie a delight to watch. <br><br>In all seriousness, The Room is a “so bad it’s good” type of movie. Anything that could go wrong when making a good movie went wrong but somehow it is still just so good. There are so many memorable quotes and moments that make you laugh every time you think back to them. While being one of the worst movies of all time it is also one of my favorite movies of all time.</p>

                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>"Oh, hi" is spoken nine times, and "Oh, hey" seven times.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Shot simultaneously on 35mm film and high-definition video. Tommy Wiseau was confused about the differences between the formats, so he used both cameras on the same mount. He also purchased the cameras instead of renting them as film productions usually do.</p></li>
                        <li><p>There are eight instances of the phrase "Don't worry about it," plus one "Don't worry about that," one "Don't worry about me," two "Don't worry about Johnny"s, one "Don't worry about those fuckers," and two plain old "Don't worry"s.</p></li>
